This is the readme file for the little Tetris Project I did in C#.

It is a CommandLine tetris inspired of the game of the same name.
By using qsd or the arrows, you make the current block go to the left, down and to the right respectfully. By pressing the spacebar, you will make the block turn and with enter, you make it fall all the way down.

I have a little scoring system to determine who is the best player.

I did it using the Rider Terminal for the colors of the blocks.
